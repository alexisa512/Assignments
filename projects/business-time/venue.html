    All workshops and dances will be held at the beautiful Clubhouse SLC. Built by the Ladies Literacy Club in 1913, the building has withstood the test of time and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It was built in Prairie-Style architecture with clean, horizontal lines, a grand auditorium, wood inlays, and beautiful, leaded glass.

    As with many downtown locations, parking can be a little confusing. Clubhouse SLC does not have a parking lot associated with it. Other parking options include street parking along South Temple, 800 East, 900 East, and across the street (North) in the neighborhood where the streets are named 1st Ave, 2nd Ave, L-Street, M-street, etc.

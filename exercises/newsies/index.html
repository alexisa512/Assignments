                In new study coding boot camps have been proven to make people exceptionally tired. These camps often have a few options for course speed. 
                The first option is full immersion where the student generally attends from 9am-6pm Monday through Friday for twelve weeks. Other options include part time, generally during the evenings Monday through Friday and online options with varying times, depending on the school offering it. 
                The full immersion programs often include free housing.
